# guess-game
This is just a simple game to test my python skills

Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. 
The rules are:
If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
On a player's first turn, if their guess is within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
if their guess is further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!" 
On all subsequent turns, if a guess is within 10 of the number return "WARMER!"
if their guess is further than 10 away from the number , return "COLDER!"
When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
